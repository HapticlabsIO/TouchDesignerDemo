# Audio and Haptics Starter

This demo is a simple example of how to simultaneously start an Audio file and a Hapticlabs track. 
- The `fieldChannelName` can be used to set the name of the track you want to trigger
- The `audiofilein` should be used to select the audio file

Make sure the satellite is connected in the `serial` block.
